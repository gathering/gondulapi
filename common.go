/*
Package gondulapi provides the framework for building a HTTP REST-API
backed by a Postgresql Database. The package can be split into three:

1. The HTTP bit, found in receiver/. This deals with accepting HTTP
requests, parsing requests and mapping them to data types. It ensures proper division
of labour, and makes it less easy to make inconsistent APIs by enforcing that
if you GET something on an URL, PUT or POST to the same URL will accept the
exact same data type back. In other words, you can do:

	GET http://foo/blatti/x > file
	vim file // Change a field
	lwp-request -m PUT http://foo/blatti/x < file

And it will do what you expect, assuming the datastructure implements both
the Getter-interface and the Putter interface.

2. The SQL bit, found in db/. This is an attempt to use reflection to avoid
having to write database queries by hand. It is not meant to cover 100% of
all SQL access. Since it makes mapping a Go data type to an SQL table easy,
it is meant to inspire good database models, where the API can mostly just
get items back and forth.

3. "Misc" - or maybe I should say, the actual Gondul API. Which at this
moment isn't actually written. Some other bits fall under this category
though, such as config file management and logging. Not very exotic.

// (over-)write the object found at the element path.

// object provided, potentially generating a new ID for it if one isn't
// provided in the data structure itself.

// idempotent, in that it should be safe to call it on already-deleted
