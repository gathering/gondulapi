// Select populates the provided interface(should be a pointer) by
// performing a simple select on the table, matching haystack with needle.
// E.g: select (elements of d) from table where haystack = needle;
//
// It is not particularly fast, and uses reflection. It is well suited for
// simple objects, but if performance is important, roll your own.
//
// It only populates exported values, and will use the "column" tag as an
// alternate name if needed. The data fields are fetched with sql.Scan(),
// so the data types need to implement sql.Scan() somehow.
//
// If the element is found, "found" is returned as true. If the element is
// found, but fails to scan, found is returned as true, but err is is
// non-nil. If an error occurred before the query is executed, or with the
// query itself (e.g.: bad table, or database issues), found is returned as
// false, and error is set. As such: if found is true, you can trust it, if
// it is false, you can only be absolutely sure the element doesn't exist
// if err is false.
//
// It needs to do two passes (might be a better way if someone better at
// the inner workings of Go reflection than me steps up). The first pass
// iterates over the fields of d, preparing both the query and allocating
// zero-values of the relevant objects. After this, the query is executed
// and the values are stored on the temporary values. The last pass stores
// them _back_ onto the original d interface.
