/*
Package objects implements a number of objects. Currently just one, though,
and a dummy-one at that.

It is intended to be imported for side effects, but there's no reason these
objects can't be exported like any other.

An object is a data structure that implements one of Putter, Getter, Poster
and Deleter from gondulapi to do RESTful stuff.

The current Thing object is intended as a demonstration.
