/*
Package objects implements a number of objects. Currently just one, though,
and a dummy-one at that.

It is intended to be imported for side effects, but there's no reason these
objects can't be exported like any other.

An object is a data structure that implements one of Putter, Getter, Poster
and Deleter from gondulapi to do RESTful stuff.

This file demonstrates three things:

1. How to implement basic GET/PUT/POST/DELETE using gondulapi/receiver.

2. How to use the simplified gondulapi/db methods to map your own interface
directly to a database element without writing SQL.

3. Implementing custom-types that are supported implicitly by gondulapi/db.

Thing is a dummy structure to illustrate the core GET/PUT/POST/DELETE

It mimics a common pattern where an object also contains its own name.

We use a tag to inform gondulapi/db that MgmtIP is mapped to the "ip"
column in the database.
