/*
Package objects implements a number of objects. Currently just one, though,
and a dummy-one at that.

It is intended to be imported for side effects, but there's no reason these
objects can't be exported like any other.

An object is a data structure that implements one of Putter, Getter, Poster
and Deleter from gondulapi to do RESTful stuff.

This file demonstrates two things:

1. How to implement basic GET/PUT/POST/DELETE using gondulapi/receiver.

2. How to use the simplified gondulapi/db methods to map your own interface
directly to a database element without writing SQL.

See types/ for how to implement custom-types not already supported by
database/sql.

/*
Thing is a dummy structure to illustrate the core GET/PUT/POST/DELETE
API.

It mimics a common pattern where an object also contains its own name.

We use a tag to inform gondulapi/db that MgmtIP is mapped to the "ip"
column in the database.

Special note here: The only way for Go to distinguish between "The variable
was not provided" and "the variable was provided, but set to the
zero-value" is if the field is a pointer. That means that if Vlan is a
nil-pointer in Put, the client didn't specify it and we should not modify
it. If, however, it is a allocated, pointing to int<0>, it was provided,
but set to 0. This is important: If you change Vlan to "Vlan int" instead
of "Vlan *int", two things will happen:

1. If a client doesn't provide vlan on an update with PUT, we will still
set it to 0.

2. If a row in the database has vlan set to NULL, we will fail to scan that
since NULL can not be converted into an int.

In general, that means you want pointers.

It also implies that you should use constraints on your database to ensure
that the values are legal. Set NOT NULL if it shouldn't be null. Set default
values if it's OK to omit it on INSERT, and so on.
