/*
Package receiver is scaffolding around net/http that facilitates a
RESTful HTTP API with certain patterns implicitly enforced:

- When working on the same urls, all Methods should use the exact same
data structures. E.g.: What you PUT is the same as what you GET out
again. No cheating.

- ETag is computed for all responses.

- All responses are JSON-encoded, including error messages.

See objects/thing.go for how to use this, but the essence is:

1. Make whatever data structure you need.
2. Implement one or more of gondulapi.Getter/Putter/Poster/Deleter.
3. Use AddHandler() to register that data structure on a URL path
4. Grab lunch.

Receiver tries to do all HTTP and caching-related tasks for you, so you
don't have to.
